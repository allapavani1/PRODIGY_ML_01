House Price Prediction
Overview:
This project uses linear regression to predict house prices based on square footage (GrLivArea), number of bedrooms (BedroomAbvGr), and bathrooms (FullBath).

Dataset:
train.csv: Training data with features and target variable.
test.csv: Test data for evaluating model performance.

Columns in the datasets:
GrLivArea: Square footage of living area.
BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms.
FullBath: Number of full bathrooms.
SalePrice: House sale price (target variable, only in train.csv).

Output
Coefficients and Intercept of the model.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set.
